        I’m Harini, an aspiring software engineer with hands-on experience in data science, full stack development, and problem-solving. I’ve completed internships in both domains and participated in national-level hackathons like the Smart India Hackathon and TN WISE Women’s Hackathon. With a strong foundation in algorithms, databases, and software design, I enjoy building impactful projects—from self-defense apps to gamified cybersecurity platforms. I'm passionate about tech innovation, continuous learning, and turning ideas into working solutions.
